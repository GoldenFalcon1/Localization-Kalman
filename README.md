# Localization-Kalman
## Project Description

This code implements the extended Kalman filter in C++. 
We are providing simulated lidar and radar measurements detecting a bicycle that travels around your vehicle. 
You will use a Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track the bicycle's position and velocity.
